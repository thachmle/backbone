Interact with Backbone 

Set up a Backbone Project
  -Create a Model & Collection Constructor (interact in console)
  -Create a Collection instance and add a handful of model instances to your collection
  
Get used to getting the properties on a specific model as well as setting/updating properties
  -Take the endpoint and create simple CRUD operations
  -Use this endpoint: http://tiy-atl-fe-server.herokuapp.com/collections/{your-name}

Test out reading/fetching data
Edit & Delete existing models. This data should persist. On URL, make sure to:
  -Create a new object
  -Read the ones created
  -Update a property on one
  -Delete (destroy) one as well.
  
Create a view instance
  -Make sure set up an element or create one in the View constructor
  -Render some data to your page
  
Use an Underscore template to display your collection data to the page.
